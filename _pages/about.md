'In God we trust, all others bring data', this quote by W Edward Deming encompasses my learning as an undergrad at the University of Mumbai. The world we live is a wondrous place but at the same time might make you lose your sanity. Data helps you to bring sanity to chaos.
<br/><br/>
I love trying make sense out of data and the joy that comes out of figuring out a puzzle. Oh yes, I do love puzzles. Academics has helped me shape my skills and given me the direction to pursue my career goals. My experience along with my fondness to build projects has buoyed my interest in working with large data sets and analytics. I believe that my current coursework will only make me more proficient in the field of data science and help me be a better data artisan that I was before.
<br/><br/>
I have a good hold of database design and development as well as data visualization tools and methods.
<br/><br/>
I am curious to apply my learning in to the real-world, and I hope you would support this quest of mine by assisting me in seeking internship opportunities.
