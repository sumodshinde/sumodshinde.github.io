'In God we trust, all others bring data,' this quote by W. Edward Deming encompasses my learning as an undergrad at the University of Mumbai. The world we live is a wondrous place, but at the same time, it might make you lose your sanity. Data helps you to bring sanity to chaos.
<br/><br/>
I love trying to make sense of data and the joy that comes from figuring out a puzzle. Oh yes, I do love puzzles. Academics have helped me shape my skills and given me the direction to pursue my career goals. My experience and fondness for building projects have buoyed my interest in working with large data sets and analytics. My prior work experience will only make me more proficient in data analytics and help me be a better data artisan than before.
<br/><br/>
I have good knowledge of database design and development and data visualization tools and methods.
<br/><br/>
I am curious to apply my learning in to the real-world, and I hope you would support this quest of mine by assisting me in seeking full time data opportunities.
